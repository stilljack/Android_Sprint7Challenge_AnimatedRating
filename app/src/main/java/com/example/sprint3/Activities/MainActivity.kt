/*          stuff we'll nneed
*          Data class to collect added items and ratings "Items"
*            dialog fragment for displaying custom view "RatingDialogFrag" & text entry field and a button to submit & needed layouts
*           customeview class "RatingView"
*           Recyclerview adapter {implement next, off top of my head, an adapter and some layout
*
*       AND HORRIBLY HARD TO MAKE (for me) animated vector drawable
*       at least i don't have to work with onTouch -- that was rough last night
*
*           I've got a feeling I'm missing something from the instructions so back
*       to the whiteboard for another ten to continue planning
